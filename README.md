# Next.js 15 Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application where the page renders blank or displays unexpected content despite seemingly correct code.  The issue may stem from data fetching, component lifecycle issues, or interactions with new features introduced in Next.js 15.

## Bug Description

The application is expected to render a simple "Welcome" message. However, instead, it displays a blank page or incorrect output.  Possible causes include incorrect data fetching, component rendering errors, or conflicts with the new features in Next.js 15.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Observe the blank page or unexpected rendering in the browser.

## Solution

The solution involves identifying and correcting the root cause of the rendering error, such as handling asynchronous data fetching correctly, addressing lifecycle method issues, or resolving any conflicts arising from the application's use of new Next.js 15 features.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version.
